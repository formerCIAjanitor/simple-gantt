## Overview

Segsy is a lightweight, interactive Gantt chart editor that runs entirely in the browser.

Many Gantt chart applications are overly complex and impractical for quickly creating simple project plans.
Rejoice! Now there is _Simple Elegant Gantt Solution for You 9000 Ultra Professional Platinum Edition Deluxe (SEGSY 9000 UPPED),_ or simply _SEGSY_.

Create clean, readable Gantt charts with minimal effort.

### Saving & sharing

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| **Auto-save** | Every change is silently saved to your browser's local storage. Closing and reopening the tab restores your work automatically. |
| **Save JSON** | Downloads a `gantt.json` file you can share with others. |
| **Load JSON** | Loads a previously saved `gantt.json` file, restoring the chart exactly. |
| **Export PNG** | Downloads a high-resolution PNG. |

Saved charts are plain JSON, making them easy to read, edit by hand, or track in Git. I assume at least one person, possibly three, will appreciate this.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "baseDate": "2026-06-01",
  "days": 30,
  "cellW": 28,
  "tasks": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Research", "start": 0, "dur": 5, "color": "#378ADD" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Internship","start": 5, "dur": 7, "color": "#1D9E75" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Write up", "start": 10, "dur": 14, "color": "#7F77DD" }
  ]
}
```

`start` and `dur` are in days relative to `baseDate`.

## Limitations

- No milestones
- No collaborative editing
- No task dependencies (yet)
